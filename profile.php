      <h4><b>Summary</b></h4>
      <p>
      During several years working at the help desk department, I developed projects and share knowledge with co-workers and stakeholders. Practice and experience in this area made me extremely capable to faced IT issues, improving my ability to handle those problems with the best cost-benefit. <br />
      I have recently expanded my repertoire to add Web Development to my growing set of capabilities, and in completing my recent Canadian education in Web and Mobile Development, I eventually aim to establish myself as a Developer with a broad view in different programming languages. <br />
      When I am not busy helping others successfully solve their technical woes, in my spare time you can find me traveling around the world, sharing experience, culture, and customs.  <br />
